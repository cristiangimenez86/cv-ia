# Use Base Development Rules (Canonical)

All AI agents working on this project must follow the consolidated rules defined in:

- `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`

## Key directives

- Single source of truth: `base-standards.mdc` defines the global rules (language policy, architecture, workflow).
- Area-specific details live in:
  - `ai-specs/specs/frontend-standards.mdc`
  - `ai-specs/specs/backend-standards.mdc`
  - `ai-specs/specs/documentation-standards.mdc`

## Do not

- Do not use absolute local filesystem paths.
- Do not introduce conflicting rules outside the canonical standards.
