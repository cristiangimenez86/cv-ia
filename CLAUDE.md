# Project Memory (CV-IA)

Follow the canonical agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`.

Key constraints:
- Next.js app in `/apps/web`
- .NET 10 API in `/services/CV.Api`
- Public chat must answer strictly from `/content/{es|en}`
- No OpenAI secrets in the browser (backend only)

If anything conflicts, `AGENTS.md` wins.
