# Documentation Standards (CV)

## 1) Language Policy

### 1.1 Technical artifacts (English only)
All technical artifacts must be written in **English**, including:
- Documentation in `/docs/**`
- Specs in `/ai-specs/specs/**`
- README files
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- API docs, design notes
- Logs, error messages, test names (also enforced by other standards)

### 1.2 CV content (bilingual exception)
CV content is **bilingual by design** and is the only official exception to the “English only” rule:
- Spanish CV content lives under `/content/es/**`
- English CV content lives under `/content/en/**`

Rules:
- Do not mix languages within the same locale folder.
- Content must exist for both locales for all core sections.

## 2) Documentation Structure

### 2.1 `/docs` (engineering documentation)
Use `/docs` for stable, long-lived documentation:
- `docs/development_guide.md` — How to run locally, prerequisites, verification
- `docs/api/api-spec.yml` — OpenAPI contract (CV, chat endpoints)
- `docs/architecture/data-model.md` — Conceptual data model
- `docs/product/` — Target audience, theme tokens, UI design brief, AI/ATS parsing

Planned (create when needed):
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — Secrets, rate limiting, public chat constraints
- `docs/DECISIONS/` — ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

### 2.2 `ai-specs/specs` (Spec Driven Development)
Each slice/feature has its own folder:
- `ai-specs/specs/<NNNN>-<slug>/spec.md` — Requirements + acceptance criteria
- `ai-specs/specs/<NNNN>-<slug>/tasks.md` — Small, sequential tasks (one at a time)

Rules:
- Specs must be clear, testable, and scoped.
- Tasks must be “baby steps”: one change at a time, verifiable after each step.

### 2.3 `/content` (CV content only)
Only CV content lives under `/content`.
No engineering docs should be placed there.

## 3) Spec Writing Guidelines (spec.md)

A `spec.md` must include:
- **Goal**: what we are building and why
- **Scope**: what is included and explicitly excluded
- **Acceptance Criteria**: measurable outcomes (pass/fail)
- **Constraints**: non-negotiables (e.g., bilingual, no secrets on frontend)
- **Verification**: commands to run (build/test/lint)

Avoid:
- Vague phrasing (“should be nice”)
- Big-bang requirements
- Hidden assumptions (ask before assuming)

## 4) Task Writing Guidelines (tasks.md)

A `tasks.md` must:
- Break work into **small sequential steps**.
- Each task must end with a **verification command**.
- Only one task should be “active” at a time.

Task format suggestion:
- Task title
- What to change
- File(s) affected
- Verification command(s)

## 5) ADR Guidelines (`/docs/DECISIONS`)

Use ADRs for decisions that change structure or long-term direction:
- Why we chose Next.js for frontend
- Why backend is .NET 10
- Why content is Markdown/JSON
- Why chat is public but restricted to CV context

ADR must include:
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences (pros/cons)
- Status (accepted/superseded)

## 6) Content Documentation Guidelines (CV)

When editing CV content files:
- Keep formatting consistent across ES/EN versions.
- Keep headings and section order aligned between languages.
- Prefer structured JSON for stable metadata (profile, skills) and Markdown for narrative sections (experience, projects).

## 7) Operational Notes (Public Chat)

Docs that mention the public chat must include:
- Rate limiting requirement
- No secrets in frontend
- “CV-context-only” behavior (if not in CV, say so)

## 8) Consistency Rules

- Do not duplicate the same rule across many files unless needed for clarity.
- If a rule is global, keep it in base standards; if it is domain-specific, keep it here or in backend/frontend standards.
- Prefer short, readable docs over long walls of text.
