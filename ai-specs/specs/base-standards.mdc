# Base Standards (CV)

## 1) Core Principles

- **Small tasks, one at a time**: Work in baby steps. Never move forward more than one step at a time.
- **Incremental changes**: Prefer small, focused diffs over large refactors.
- **Question assumptions**: If anything is unclear or missing, **ask before assuming**.
- **Verifiable progress**: Every change must include a clear way to verify (build/test/lint or a minimal manual check).
- **Type safety**: All code must be fully typed (TypeScript strict, C# nullable enabled).
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, types, and files.
- **Pattern detection**: Detect repeated patterns and propose refactors only when justified by the current spec.

## 2) Language Policy

### 2.1 Technical artifacts: English only
All technical artifacts must always use **English**, including:
- Code (variables, functions, classes, comments, error messages, log messages)
- Documentation (README, guides, API docs, specs, ADRs)
- Data schemas and database names
- Configuration files and scripts
- Git commit messages
- Test names and descriptions

### 2.2 CV content: bilingual exception
The only official exception is **CV content**, which is bilingual by design:
- Spanish CV content lives under `/content/es/**`
- English CV content lives under `/content/en/**`

Rules:
- Do not mix languages within the same locale folder.
- Keep section order aligned across ES/EN where applicable.

## 3) Project Constraints (Non-negotiables)

- Architecture: **Next.js** frontend in `/apps/web` + **.NET 10** API backend in `/services/CV.Api` (separate services).
- Both services must be dockerized. Local dev uses docker-compose.
- CV content is data-first: Markdown/JSON under `/content/{es|en}`. Do NOT hardcode CV content in React components.
- Public chat is allowed, but answers must be restricted strictly to CV context.
- OpenAI API keys and secrets must live ONLY in the .NET backend. Never place secrets in frontend code or client-side env vars.

## 4) Working Style for Agents

- Keep scope limited to the current spec/slice.
- If a new dependency is needed, ask first and justify briefly.
- Prefer changes that improve clarity and maintainability without over-engineering.
- After implementing, provide the exact commands to verify the change.

## 5) Specific Standards

For detailed standards and guidelines specific to different areas of the project, refer to:

- [Frontend Standards](./frontend-standards.mdc) — Next.js App Router, SEO/AI-friendly rendering, bilingual content loading
- [Documentation Standards](./documentation-standards.mdc) — Docs/specs/ADRs structure and bilingual CV content rules
