# Codex Instructions (CV)

Use `AGENTS.md` as the single source of truth for project instructions.

Do not:
- introduce browser-side OpenAI calls
- hardcode CV data into React components
- change the repo structure (`/apps/web`, `/services/CV.Api`, `/content/{es|en}`)

Always include a verification step for any change.
